- The data contains information on patient visits, including patient ID, age, gender, visit date, diagnosis, and outcomes.

## Data Preparation
- The raw data was cleaned and transformed using Excel Power Query.
- Unnecessary columns were removed, and missing values were handled appropriately.
- Data types were corrected, and consistent formatting was applied.

## KPIs Tracked
- Total Patient Visits
- Average Patient Age
- Gender Distribution (Male/Female)
- Visit Distribution by Weekday
- Top 5 Diagnoses by Patient Count
- Patient Outcome Distribution (Admitted, Discharged, etc.)

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive visualizations using Pivot Charts and Slicers.
- Gender Distribution and Patient Outcome displayed using Pie Charts.
- Visit Distribution by Weekday visualized using a Bar Chart.
- Top 5 Diagnoses displayed in a List Chart.

## Project Highlights
- Efficient data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.
- Interactive analysis through Excel Power Pivot.
- User-friendly dashboard design for clear insights.

## Technical Details
- Created custom calculated columns in Power Pivot using DAX formulas, including:
  - **Age Group** classification to segment patients by age ranges.
  - **Patient Attend Status** to label patients as 'Ontime' or 'Delay' based on their wait time (30 minutes threshold).

## How to Use
